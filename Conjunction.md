## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **conjunction** is a logical [[Connectives|connective]] joining two [[Propositions|propositions]], which results in a new proposition that is true only when both propositions are true. It is the logical version of the english word "and". The notation for a conjunction is the symbol $\wedge$, and we pronounced $A \wedge B$ as "$A$ and $B$". 

The [[Truth tables|truth table]] for the conjunction $A \wedge B$ is: 

| $A$   | $B$   | $A \wedge B$ |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| True  | True  | True         |
| True  | False | False        |
| False | True  | False        |
| False | False | False             |

Again, $A \wedge B$ is true only when both $A$ and $B$ are true.
