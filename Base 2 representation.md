## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> An [[Integers|integer]] is written in **base 2** or **binary** format if it consists of a string of the numbers $0$ and $1$, called **[[binary digits]]** or "**bits**",  that represent groupings of power of 2. 

Notes: 
- A group of 8 bits is known as a **byte**. 
- Every positive integer can in fact be written as a sum of powers of 2 and in only one way. This fact can be proven using [[mathematical induction]].
## Examples 


The number $267$ can be written as a sum of powers of $2$ as follows: 
$$267 = 256 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 2^8 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0$$
Using $0$ to pad this sum with groups that are not used, we get: 
$$267 = 256 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 1 \cdot 2^8 + 0 \cdot 2^2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0$$
