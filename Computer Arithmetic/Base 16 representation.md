## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> An [[Integers|integer]] is written in **base 16** or **hexadecimal** format if it consists of a string of the numbers $0$ through $9$ and letters $A$ through $F$ that represent groupings of powers of 16. 

Notes: 

- In hexadecimal, the letter $A$ represents the [[Base 10 representation|base 10]] number $10$; $B$ represents $11$; $C$ represents $12$; $D$ represents $13$; $E$ represents $14$; and $F$ represents $15$. 
- The alphabetical digits are needed to have more than ten copies of a power of 16. 
- The first few powers of 16 are: $16^0 = 1$, $16^1 = 16$, $16^2 = 256$, $16^3 = 4096$. These are all powers of 2 as well, since $16= 2^4$. 

## Examples 

The number $2670$ can be written as a sum of powers of $16$ as follows: 
$$2670 = 10 \times 256 + 6 \times 16 + 14 \times 1 = 10 \times 16^2 + 6 \times 16^1 + 14 \times 16^0$$
Using the multipliers in front of the powers of $16$ and replacing $10$ and $14$ with $A$ and $E$ respectively, we get 
$$2670 \ \text{base 10}  = A6E \ \text{base 16}$$
A subscript is often used to indicate which base we mean: $2670_{10} = A6E_{16}$. 

Likewise, the number 2561 is $$10 \times 256 + 0 \times 16 + 1 \times 1$$so $2561_{10} = A01_{16}$.

## Practice 

1. Generate a random positive integer. Start small (1-4) digits at first. [Use this website](https://www.random.org/integers/) to generate random integers. 
2. Write the integer as a sum of powers of 16, then write its hexadecimal form. 
3. Check your work using the websites above.
