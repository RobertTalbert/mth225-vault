## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> An [[Integers|integer]] is written in **base 10** or **decimal** format if it consists of a string of digits, all between $0$ and $9$, that represent groupings of power of 10. 

## Examples 

Base 10 is the standard way of writing positive [[integers]] we learn in school. The digits represent place value. For example the [[Integers|integer]] $267$ has 7 in the "ones place", 6 in the "tens place", and 2 in the "hundreds place". This means that this number consists of 2 copies or groups of $100$, 6 copies of $10$, and 7 copies of $1$. We can write this fact as: 
$$267 = 2 \times 100 + 6 \times 10 + 7 \times 1$$
Each of the groups is represented by a power of 10, so we can also write this as: 
$$267 = 2 \times 10^2 + 6 \times 10^1 + 7 \times 10^0$$

**Another example:** The number $90125$, tho
