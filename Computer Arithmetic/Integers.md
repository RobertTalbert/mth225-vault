## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> An **integer** is a whole number. That is, an integer is any number from the list $\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots$. The set of all integers is denoted $\mathbb{Z}$. 

Integers form the building blocks of mathematics and are the central organizing tool for computer mathematics particularly. 

## Examples and Non-Examples 

Some examples of integers include $10$, $99999$, $-20$, and $0$. 

Some non-integers include: 
- $1/2$ (not a whole nbumber)
- $\sqrt{5}$ (also not a whole number) 
- $2 + 3i$ (not a real number) 
- $\infty$ (not a number at all)
