## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **natural number** is any non-negative [[Integers|integer]]. That is, a natural number is any number from the list $0, 1, 2, 3, \dots$. The set of all natural numbers is denoted $\mathbb{N}$. 

While [[integers]] form the backbone of all computer mathematics, the natural numbers are a subset of the [[integers]] and are the primary tool used for counting things. For example, Python uses the natural numbers for the function `range` which is used to iterate through looping structures. 

Note that **for our purposes, the number $0$ is included in the natural numbers**. This is not always the case in every textbook or learning resource. So when looking up information in other books or websites about natural numbers or statements involving natural numbers, *check first to see if they include 0.*
## Examples and Non-Examples 

Some examples of natural numbers include $10$, $99999$, and $0$. 

Some non-[[integers]] include: 
- $-12$ (negative) 
- $1/2$ (not a whole nbumber)
- $\sqrt{5}$ (also not a [[Integers|whole number]]) 
- $2 + 3i$ (not a real number) 
- $\infty$ (not a number at all)
