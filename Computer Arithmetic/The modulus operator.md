## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **modulus operator** `%` when applied to two integers $a$ and $b$, returns the unique value of the remainder $r$ given by the [[The division algorithm|Division Algorithm]] when dividing $a$ by $b$. 

Notes:
- The symbol `%` is used in Python and many other languages to implement the modulus operator. 
- According to the [[The division algorithm|Division Algorithm]], the result of `a % b` is always strictly less than $b$. 
- If $b = 0$ then `a % b` is undefined (and will throw an error in Python). 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- `100 % 8 = 4` because $8$ divides $100$, $12$ times with a remainder of $4$. 
- `100 % 5 = 0` because $5$ evenly divides $100$. 
- `225225 % 3 = `
