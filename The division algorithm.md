## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **Division Algorithm** is a mathematical [[theorem]] that states the following: 
> 
> For any two positive integers $a$ and $b$, there exist unique integers $q$ (the *quotient*) and $r$ (the *remainder*) such that $a = bq + r$ and $0 \leq r < b$. 

Notes: 
- The Division Algorithm as a [[theorem]] does not state how the integers $q$ and $r$ are to be computed; it only asserts that they exist, and there is only one such pair that satisfies both of the requirements ($a = bq + r$ and $0 \leq r < b$). 
- The final requirement in the Division Algorithm statement, asserts that the remainder in the integer division process has to be strictly smaller than the divisor. This has important i
