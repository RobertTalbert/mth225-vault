## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **codomain** of a [[Function|function]] is the set consisting of all allowable outputs of that function. In standard function notation, if $f: A \rightarrow B$ is a function then the set $B$ is the codomain. 

Notes: 
- The codomain of $f$ contains the [[Range|range]] of the function as a [[Subset|subset]], but the two are not necessarily equal. See examples below. 
- Informally we can think of the codomain as specifying the "data type" of the outputs. For example the ceiling function $ceil: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ that takes a real number and rounds it up, has a codomain of $\mathbb{Z}$ which indicates that the outputs are of "type integer".
