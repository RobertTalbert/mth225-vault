## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A set $B$ is a **subset** of another set $A$, if every element of $B$ is also an element of $A$. If $B$ is a subset of $A$, this relationship is denoted $B \subseteq A$.  
> 
> If $B \subset A$ but $B \neq A$, we say that $B$ is a **proper subset** of $A$ and write $B \subset A$. 

A visual representation of the relationship $B \subseteq A$ is this Venn diagram:

(This is actually showing that $B$ is a proper subset of $A$ since the two are not shown as being equal.)

In terms of logical propositions, 
## Examples and Non-Examples

Examples: 
- The [[natural numbers]] are a (proper) subset of the [[integers]]. (That is, $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.)
