## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A set $B$ is a **subset** of another set $A$, if every element of $B$ is also an element of $A$. If $B$ is a subset of $A$, this relationship is denoted $B \subseteq A$.  
> 
> If $B \subset A$ but $B \neq A$, we say that $B$ is a **proper subset** of $A$ and write $B \subset A$. 

A visual representation of the relationship $B \subseteq A$ is this Venn diagram:

(This is actually showing that $B$ is a proper subset of $A$ since the two are not shown as being equal.)

In terms of logical propositions, $B$ is a subset of $A$ if the following [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]] is true: 

> For every $x$, if $x \in B$ then $x \in A$. 
## Examples and Non-Examples

Examples: 
- The [[natural numbers]] are a (proper) subset of the [[integers]]. (That is, $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$.)
- The set $\{0,1,2,3\}$ is a (proper) subset of $\mathbb{N}$. 
- The set $\{0,2,4\}$ is a (proper) subset of the set $\{0,2,4,6,8\}$. 
- The set 

Non-examples: 
- The set of integers is not a subset of the set of natural numbers, because there are elements of the integers that don't belong to the natural numbers, such as $-3$. 
- The set $\{1,2,3\}$ is not a subset of $\{2,3,4\}$ because although these sets have elements in common (i.e. the intersection is not the empty set), the nu
