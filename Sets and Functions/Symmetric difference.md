## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> If $A$ and $B$ are [[Set|sets]], the **symmetric difference** of $A$ and $B$ is the set whose [[Set|elements]] are all the elements that are in either $A$ or $B$, but not in both. In notation, the symmetric difference of $A$ and $B$ is written $A \triangle B$. In [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]], 
> $$A \triangle B = \{ x \, : \, x \in A \cup B \ \text{and} \ x \not \in A \cap B\}$$

A visual representation of $A \triangle B$ is this Venn diagram:
