## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **set** is an unordered collection of distinct objects. An item that belongs to a set is said to be an **element** of the set. If $x$ is an element of the set $A$, we denote this by $x \in A$ ("$x$ is an element of $A$"). If $x$ is not an element of the set $A$, we denote this by $x \not \in A$. 

Notes
* Sets can be described in a few different ways: 
	* In words, for example "the set of all current MTH 225 students at Grand Valley State University"
	* As a symbol, usually a capital letter ($A$, $X$, etc.)
	* For some commonly-used sets we use a special letter -- for example $\mathbb{N}$ denotes the set of all [[Natural numbers]] and $\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the set of all [[Integers]]. 
	* In roster notation, where we list the items of the set explicitly within curly braces, for example $\{0, 2, 4, 6\}$.
	* In [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]], where we describe the set using rules for deciding what its elements are, for example $\{n \in \mathbb{N} \, : \, n \ \text{is even and} \ 0 \leq n < 7\}$. This set is equal to $\{0,2,4,6\}$ 
* The word "distinct" in the definition indicates that **sets cannot contain duplicate items**. For example $\{2,2,2,2,2\}$ is not a properly-written set. This set is the same as $\{2\}$ and should be written this way, without duplicates. 
## Examples and Non-Examples

$\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \, : \, $n$ \text{is even and} \, n < 7}$.
