## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **function** is a rule that accepts input from one set and produces output in another set, so that every input is assigned to one and only one output. If the inputs come from from the set $A$ and the outputs come from the set $B$, and the name of the function is $f$, then we write $f: A \rightarrow B$. 

Notes: 
- In the notation above ($f: A \rightarrow B$) the set $A$ is the [[Domain|domain]] of the function and the set $B$ is the [[codomain]]. 
- If $x \in A$, then the output that is assigned to $x$ by the function $f$ is notated $f(x)$ ("f of x"). This is sometimes called the *image* of $x$.
- In order for a rule of assignment to be a valid function according to this definition, two things must happen: 
	- Every point in $A$ (the [[Domain|domain]] of $f$) must actually have an output; that is, there can be no elements of $A$ that are unassigned or uncomputable.
