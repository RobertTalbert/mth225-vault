## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> If $A$ and $B$ are [[sets]], the **Cartesian product** of $A$ and $B$ is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate is an [[Set|element]] of $A$ and whose second coordinate is an element of $B$. In notation, the Cartesian product of $A$ and $B$ is written $A \times B$. In [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]], 
> $$A \times B = \{ (x,y) \, : \, x \in A \ \text{and} \ y \in B\}$$

**Notes:**
- The symbol $\times$ does 
- The order of sets in a Cartesian product matters: $A \times B$ is not the same set as $B \times A$ because the pairs in the Cartesian product are *ordered* pairs -- switching coordinates does not keep the ordered pairs equal. 
- In Python terminology, the elements of a Cartesian product are [tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp) with two elements. 
- It is possible to similarly define the Cartesian product of more than two sets, using tuples that have more than two elements. For example $A \times B \times C$ would be the set of all three-element tuples with the first coordinate in $A$, the second in $B$, and the third in $C$.
