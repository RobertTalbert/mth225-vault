## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> If $A$ and $B$ are [[sets]], the **Cartesian product** of $A$ and $B$ is the set of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate is an [[Set|element]] of $A$ and whose second coordinate is an element of $B$. In notation, the Cartesian product of $A$ and $B$ is written $A \times B$. In [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]], 
> $$A \times B = \{ (x,y) \, : \, x \in A \ \text{and} \ y \in B\}$$

**Notes:**
- The symbol $\times$ does *not* mean "multiplication" in this context. 
- The order of sets in a Cartesian product matters: $A \times B$ is not the same set as $B \times A$ because the pairs in the Cartesian product are *ordered* pairs -- switching coordinates does not keep the ordered pairs equal. 
- In Python terminology, the elements of a Cartesian product are [tuples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp) with two elements. 
- It is possible to similarly define the Cartesian product of more than two sets, using tuples that have more than two elements. For example $A \times B \times C$ would be the set of all three-element tuples with the first coordinate in $A$, the second in $B$, and the third in $C$. 
- If $A$ is a finite set with [[Cardinality|cardinality]] equal to $N$, and $B$ is finite with cardinality $M$, then $A \times B$ has cardinality $N \cdot M$ since $A \times B$ contains all the combinations of elements from $A$ and $B$. 

## Examples 

* Let $A = \{0,1,2\}$ and $B = \{s,t\}$. Then $A \times B = \{(0,s), (0,t), (1,s), (1,t), (2,s), (2,t)\}$. 
* Let $S = \{x,y,z\}$. Then $S \times S$ is the set of all ordered pairs whose coordinates from from $S$: $\{(x,x), (x,y), (x,z), (y,x), (y,y), (y,z), (z,x), (z,y), (z,z)\}$. 
* We can also find the Cartesian product of infinite sets. For example, if $S = \{x,y,z\}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of all [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]], then 
$$S \times \mathbb{N} = \{(x,0), (y,0), (z,0), (x,1), (y,1), (z,1), (x,2), (y,2), (z,2), \dots\}$$

## Practice 

You can practice this concept for finite sets using Python's list data structure. 

1. Choose two finite sets $A$ and $B$ and write them out in [[Roster notation|roster notation]]. 
2. By hand, write out what you think $A \times B$ is, again in roster notation. 
3. Then enter in $A$ and $B$ as Python lists in the following code and run it. Check the results against your work by hand. 

```python
A = # Put your set A here as a list, using the [ ] delimiters
B = # Put your set B here as a list, using the [ ] delimiters
product = [(a,b) for a in A for b in B]
print(product)
```
