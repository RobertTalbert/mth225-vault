## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **union** of two [[Set|sets]] $A$ and $B$ is the set consisting of [[Set|elements]] that are in either $A$, or $B$ (or both). The notation for the union of $A$ and $B$ is $A \cup B$. 
> 
> In [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]], $A \cup B = \{x \, : \, x \in A \ \text{or} \ x \in B\}$.

A visual representation of $A \cup B$ is this Venn diagram:

**Notes:**
- If $A \subseteq B$ (that is, $A$ is a [[Subset|subset]] of $B$) then $A \cup B = B$. 

## Examples 
- If $A = \{1,2,3,4\}$ and $B = \{1,3,5,7,9\}$ then $A \cup B = \{1,2,3,4,5,7,9\}$. Note that although $3$ appears in both sets, we do not list it twice in the union -- because no duplicates are allowed inside a set. 
- If $A = \{n \in \mathbb{N} \, : \, n \ \text{is odd and greater than 3}\}$ and $B =  \{n \in \mathbb{N}  \, : \, n \ \text{is even and greater than 3}\}$ then $A \cup B = \{4,5,6,7,8,\dots\}$.
