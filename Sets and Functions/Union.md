## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **union** of two [[Set|sets]] $A$ and $B$ is the set consisting of [[Set|elements]] that are in either $A$, or $B$ (or both). The notation for the union of $A$ and $B$ is $A \cup B$. 
> 
> In [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]], $A \cup B = \{x \, : \, x \in A \ \text{or} \ x \in B\}$.

A visual representation of $A \cup B$ is this Venn diagram:
