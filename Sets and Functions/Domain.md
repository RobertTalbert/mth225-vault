## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **domain** of a function is the [[set]] of all possible inputs of the function. 

Notes: 
- The word "possible" in the definition indicates that we exclude any potential inputs that cannot be computed using the function. For example, the domain of the function $f(x) = 1/x$ is the [[set]] of all real numbers *except* zero.
