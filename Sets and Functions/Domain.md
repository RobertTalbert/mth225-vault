## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **domain** of a [[function]] is the [[set]] of all possible inputs of the function. 

Notes: 
- The word "possible" in the definition indicates that we exclude any potential inputs that cannot be computed using the function. For example, the domain of the function $f(x) = 1/x$ is the [[set]] of all real numbers *except* zero. 
- The concept of domain also applies to [[Predicate|predicates]], which can be thought of as functions whose [[Codomain]] is the [[set]] of Booleans `{True, False}`. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- When a function $f$ is described using "arrow" notation, the domain is the set on the left side of the arrow. For example $f: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ given by $f(a) = |a|$, has domain equal to the integers $\mathbb{Z}$. 
- For predicates and some functions not given in this notation, the domain should be either stated explicitly or determined from context. For example the predicate $P(x)$ given by the statement "$x$ is even" would have a domain equal to either the integers or the natural numbers, because no other object makes sense when the word "even" is applied to it.
