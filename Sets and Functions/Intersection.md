## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **intersection** of two [[Set|sets]] $A$ and $B$ is the set consisting of [[Set|elements]] that are in both $A$ and $B$. The notation for the union of $A$ and $B$ is $A \cap B$. 
> 
> In [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]], $A \cap B = \{x \, : \, x \in A \ \text{and} \ x \in B\}$.

A visual representation of $A \cap B$ is this Venn diagram:

**Notes:**

- If $A$ and $B$ have no elements in common, then $A \cap B = \emptyset$ (the [[Empty set|empty set]]) and we sa

## Examples 

- If $A = \{1,2,3,4\}$ and $B = \{1,3,5,7,9\}$ then $A \cap B = \{3\}$. 
- If $A = \{n \in \mathbb{N} \, : \, n \ \text{is a multiplee of 3}\}$ and $B =  \{n \in \mathbb{N} \, : \, n \ \text{is a multiple of 2}\}$ then $A \cup B = \{0, 6, 12, 18, 24, \dots\}$ -- in other words all the natural numbers that are multiples of both $3$ and $2$ (which makes them multiples of $6$).
