## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A [[Function|function]] $f: A \rightarrow B$ is **injective** if, for all pairs of inputs $a_1, a_2 \in A$, if $a_1 \neq a_2$ then $f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)$. 

**Notes:**
- An informal English way of describing injective functions is: If two inputs are different, then their outputs are different if the function is injective. In other words there are no "collisions" where different inputs are mapped to the same output. 
- An equivalent way to define an injective function is to use the [[Contrapositive|contrapositive]] of the [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]] in the above definition: The function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is injective if, for all $a_1, a_2 \in A$, if $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ then $a_1 = a_2$.
