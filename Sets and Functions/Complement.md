## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> If $A$ is a set, the **complement** of $A$ is the set of all points in the [[Universal set|universal set]] that are not in $A$. The notation for the complement of $A$ is $\overline{A}$.
> 
> In [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]], $\overline{A} = \{ x \in U \, : \, x \not \in A\}$ (where $U$ is the universal set). 

A visual representation of $\overline{A}$ is this Venn diagram:

**Notes:**

- The complement of $A$ is also $U \setminus A$, the [[Set difference|set difference]] between the [[Universal set|universal set]] and $A$. 
- Some alternative notation for the complement of $A$ includes $A'$ , $A^c$, and $A^*$. 

## Examples 

- If $U = \{1,2,3,\dots, 10\}$ and $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, then $\overline{A} = \{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$. 
- If the universal set is $\mathbb{N}$ (the [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]]) and $A = \{n \in \mathbb{N} \, : \, n \ \text{is a multiple of 2}\}$ then $\overline{A}$ is the set of natural numbers that are not multiples of 2 -- that is, the set of all odd natural numbers.
