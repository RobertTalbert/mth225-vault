## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> If $A$ is any set, then its **power set**, denoted $\mathcal{P}(A)$, is the set whose elements are the subsets of $A$. 

Notes: 
- $A$ is not a subset of $\mathcal{P}(A)$; but $A$ is an element of $\mathcal{P}(A)$ since $A$ is a subset of itself. 
- The [[Empty set|empty set]] $\emptyset$ is always an element of $\mathcal{P}(A)$ for any set, since $\emptyset \subseteq A$ for all $A$. 
- If $A$ is finite with $n$ elements, then $|\mathcal{P}(A)|$ (the [[Cardinality|cardinality]] of the power set) is $2^n$. This is a basic fact resulting from the way the [[binomial coefficient]] is defined. 

## Examples

- If $A = \{1,2\}$, then $\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\} \}$. 
- If $B$ = $\{x,y,z\}$ then $\mathcal{P}(B) = \{\emptyset, \{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\}, \{x,y\}, \{x,z\}, \{y,z\}, \{x,y,z\}\}$. 
- The power set of the empty set $\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)$ is $\{ \emptyset \}$. That is, $\mathcal{P}(\emptyset)$ is not empty, but contains one element -- namely the empty set itself.
