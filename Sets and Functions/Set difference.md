## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **difference** between the [[Set|sets]] $A$ and $B$, denoted either $A - B$ or $A \setminus B$, is the set whose [[Set|elements]] are the elements of $A$ which are not in $B$. 
> 
> In [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]], $A \setminus B = \{ x \, : \, x \in A \ \text{and} \ x \not \in B\}$. 

A visual representation of $A \setminus B$ is this Venn diagram:

**Notes:**

- The order matters in set differences just as it does in subtraction: $A \setminus B$ is not the same set as $B \setminus A$. See the examples below. 

## Examples 

- If $A = \{1,2,3,4\}$ and $B = \{1,3,5,7,9\}$ then $A \setminus B = \{1,2,4\}$, and $B \setminus A = \{5,7,9\}$.  
- If $A = \{n \in \mathbb{N} \, : \, n \ \text{is a multiple of 3}\}$ and $B =  \{n \in \mathbb{N} \, : \, n \ \text{is a multiple of 2}\}$ then $A \setminus B$ is the set of natural numbers that are multiples of $3$ but not multiples of $2$ (that is, not even): $\{3, 9, 15, 21, \dots\}$. On the other hand $B \setminus A$ is the set of natural numbers that are multiples of $2$ (i.e. even numbers) but which are not multiples of $3$: $\{2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20, 22, 26, \dots\}$.
