## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Roster notation** is a way of writing [[set]] in which the set [[Set|elements]] are given explicitly in a list, surrounded by curly braces. 

Notes: 
- If the set is finite, then the set in roster notation is just a list of all its elements. 
- If the set is infinite, correct roster notation would list enough elements to indicate the pattern for inclusion in the set, then indicate that the pattern continues with dots ($\dots$). If it's difficult or impossible to indicate a pattern, [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]] or an English description is usually more appropriate. 
- The [[Empty set|empty set]] $\emptyset$ is considered to be in roster notation -- there's nothing in it, so there's nothing to list. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- The set of all positive integers less than 7, written in roster notation is $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. 
- The set of all positive divisors of 20, written in roster notation is $\{1,2,4,5,10,20\}$. 
- The set of all positive *multiples* of 20, on the other hand, is infinite. In roster notation this would look like $\{20, 40, 60, 80, 100, \dots\}$ where the dots indicate that the pattern (which is supposed to be apparent from the items that are listed) continues.
