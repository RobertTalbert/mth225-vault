## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Roster notation** is a way of writing [[set]] in which the set [[Set|elements]] are given explicitly in a list, surrounded by curly braces. 

Notes: 
- If the set is finite, then the set in roster notation is just a list of all its elements. 
- If the set is infinite, correct roster notation would list enough elements to indicate the pattern for inclusion in the set, then indicate that the pattern continues with dots ($\dots$). If it's difficult or impossible to indicate a pattern, [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]] or an English description is usually more appropriate. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- The set of all positive integers less than 7 in roster notation s
