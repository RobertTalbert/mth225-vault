## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Set-builder notation** is a way of writing a [[Set and set elements|set]] where the set is defined by the rules that its elements must satisfy in order to be [[Set and set elements|elements]] of the set. Set-builder notation has two forms: 
> 
> - ("*Domain/filter*") The universal set from which elements are selected is given first, then a [[Predicate|predicate]] that filters out all but the elements of the set. 
> - ("*Formula/domain*") A formula is given first, then a universal set on which the formula is applied. 
>   
>   Examples of each form are below.
