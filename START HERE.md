**Welcome to the course vault for MTH 225: Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1** at [Grand Valley State University](http://www.gvsu.edu). 

This website contains articles for all the important concepts in the course. The articles are **linked together** like Wikipedia articles so you can go from one article to any related article in one click. Many articles contain embedded video pulled from [the course video repository on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8667148) as well, which makes the vault our default "textbook". 

Each article has a **graph view** that visually shows the interconnections between the article and others. For example, the graph view for [[Predicate]] looks like this: 

![[graphview.jpg|300]]

Each article in the vault is a node in this network (or "graph"), and there is an edge between any two nodes if there is a link from one article to the other. To jump to any article connected to [[Predicate]], just click on the node. Nodes in the graph that are greyed out (like "codomain" above) indicate articles that have not yet been written. Please note, the vault is constantly changing and 

There is a secondary textbook for MTH 225 -- [Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html) by Oscar Levin that you can use to go along with this vault in case you need a more traditional textbook approach. However, this textbook does not cover all the topics in MTH 225, for example there is no coverage of computer arithmetic.
