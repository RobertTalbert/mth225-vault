**Welcome to the course vault for MTH 225: Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1** at [Grand Valley State University](http://www.gvsu.edu). 

This website contains articles for all the important concepts in the course. The articles are **linked together** like Wikipedia articles so you can go from one article to any related article in one click. Many articles contain embedded video pulled from [the course video repository on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8667148) as well, which makes the vault our default "textbook". 

There is a secondary textbook for MTH 225 -- [Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html) by Oscar Levin that you can use to go along with this vault in case you need a more traditional textbook approach. However, this textbook does not cover all the topics in MTH 225, for example there is no coverage of []
