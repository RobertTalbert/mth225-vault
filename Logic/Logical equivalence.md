## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> Two [[propositions]] are said to be **logically equivalent** if they have the same truth value in each variation of truth values in their [[Atomic and molecular propositions|atomic statements]]. If $P$ and $Q$ are logically equivalent, we write $P \equiv Q$. 

Notes: 
- Two logically equivalent propositions will have the same [[Truth tables|truth tables]] for each possible combination of truth values. In fact, one way to determine if two propositions are logically equivalent, is to construct and then compare their truth tables. 
- Another way to determine if two propositions are logically equivalent is to use logical operations to manipulate one proposition into another. 
- Variations on the notation $\equiv$ exist. For example, sometimes it's written $P \cong Q$, or $P \sim Q$. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

The propositions $P \rightarrow Q$ and $(\neg P) \vee Q$ are logically equivalent, as shown by their truth tables:
