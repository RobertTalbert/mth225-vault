## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **truth set** of a [[Predicate|predicate]] $P(x)$ is the [[set]] of all values of $x$ that make the predicate true. 

Notes: 
- The truth set of a predicate is always a subset of (and is sometimes equal to) the [[domain]] of the predicate. 

## Examples

Here are some predicates and their truth sets: 

| Predicate                                   | Truth set                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| The [[natural number]] $n$ is a perfect square. | $\{0,1,4,9,16,25,36,\dots\}$ |
| There are $2^n$  of length $n$. |  $\mathbb{N}$ (The predicate is true for all [[Natural numbers]])                                        |
