## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **truth set** of a [[Predicate|predicate]] $P(x)$ is the [[Set]] of all values of $x$ that make the predicate true. 

Notes: 
- The truth set of a predicate is always a subset of (and is sometimes equal to) the [[domain]] of the predicate. 

## Examples

Here are some predicates and their truth sets: 

| Predicate                                                       | Truth set                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The natural number $n$ is a perfect square.                     | $\{0,1,4,9,16,25,36,\dots\}$                                     |
| There are $2^n$ bitstrings of length $n$.                       | $\mathbb{N}$ (The predicate is true for all [[Natural numbers]]) |
| $x$ is a state in the United States with four or fewer letters. | $\{\text{Iowa, Ohio, Utah}\}$                                                                 |
