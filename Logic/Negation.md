## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **negation** of a [[Propositions|proposition]] is another proposition with the opposite truth values. In mathematical notation, the negation of the proposition $P$ is $\neg P$ which is pronounced "not $P$". 

Notes: 

- The English phrasing of a negation is often just putting the word "not" in the original [[Propositions|proposition]], but this sometimes leads to unintelligible statements. Often, some care is needed to phrase a negation in a way that makes sense to a listener or reader. 
- The [[Truth tables|truth table]] for the negation of a statement is built simply by reversing the truth values of the original. The basic truth table for $\neg P$ is: 

| $P$   | $\neg P$ |
| ----- | -------- |
| True  | False    |
| False | True         |
