> A [[Predicate|predicate]] is **universally quantified** when we assert that the predicate is true for all values of one or more of its variables. A **universal quantifier** is a logical operator that declares that the predicate is true for all values of a variable. If $P(x)$ is a predicate, then the statement "For all values of $x$, $P(x)$ is true" is its universally quantified form. Symbolically we write this as $\forall x P(x)$. 

Notes: 
- Whereas the single-variable predicate $P(x)$ is not a [[Propositions|proposition]] because its truth value depends on the input $x$, its universally quantified form $\forall x P(x)$ is a proposition with a definite truth value. For example, the statement "The integer $n$ is even" is a predicate that is sometimes true and sometimes false; the quantified form "For every integer $n$, $n$ is even" is
