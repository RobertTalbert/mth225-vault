## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A [[Predicate|predicate]] is **universally quantified** when we assert that the predicate is true for all values of one or more of its variables. A **universal quantifier** is a logical operator that declares that the predicate is true for all values of a variable. If $P(x)$ is a predicate, then the statement "For all values of $x$, $P(x)$ is true" is its universally quantified form. Symbolically we write this as $\forall x P(x)$. 

Notes: 
- Whereas the single-variable predicate $P(x)$ is not a [[Propositions|proposition]] because its truth value depends on the input $x$, its universally quantified form $\forall x P(x)$ is a proposition with a definite truth value. For example, the statement "The integer $n$ is even" is a predicate that is sometimes true and sometimes false; the quantified form "For every integer $n$, $n$ is even" is definitely false (and is therefore a [[Propositions|proposition]]). 
- If a predicate has more than one variable input, quantifying one of those variables does not produce a proposition, but rather another predicate with unquantified variables. The remaining unquantified variables are said to be *undetermined* while the quantified variables are *bound*. 
- If a predicate has more than one variable input, quantifying *all* the variables produces a [[Propositions|proposition]]. For example "$a+b$ is even" is not a proposition because it is sometimes true and sometimes false, depending on the values of $a$ and $b$. But the statement "For all integers $a$ and $b$, $a+b$ is even" is simply false (because the statement is not true "for all" integers $a$ and $b$, for example $a = 2$, $b=1$
