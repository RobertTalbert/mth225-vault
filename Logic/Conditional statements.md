## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **conditional statement** is a [[Propositions|proposition]] that has the form "If $A$, then $B$" where $A$ and $B$ are [[Atomic and molecular propositions|atomic statements]]. The proposition $A$ in the "if" part is called the **hypothesis** of the conditional statement, and the proposition $B$ in the "then" part is called the **conclusion**. 
> 
> The conditional statement "If $A$ then $B$" is written in mathematical notation as $A \rightarrow B$. 

Notes:
- Conditional statements need not literally be phrased as "if-then" statements; any phrasing that indicates a conclusion follows from a hypothesis is equivalent. For example, here are five different ways to phrase the conditional statement "If it's snowing, then it's cold": 
	- *Snowing implies that it's cold*.
	- *It's cold whenever it's snowing.*
	- *Snowing is a sufficient condition for it to be cold.*
	- *Being cold is a consequence of it snowing.*
	- *Being cold follows from it snowing.*
