## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **DeMorgan's Laws** refers to either a pair of properties about logical operators, or about set operations. 
> 1. (*Logical operators*) DeMorgan's Laws state that if $A$, and $B$ are [[Propositions|propositions]], then: 
>    $$\neg (A \vee B) \equiv (\neg A) \wedge (\neg B) \quad \text{and} \quad \neg (A \wedge B) \equiv (\neg A) \vee (\neg B)$$
> 2. (*Set operations*) DeMorgan's Laws state that if $U$ and $V$ are [[sets]], then 
>    $$\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cap \overline{B} \quad \text{and} \quad  \overline{A \cap B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$$
