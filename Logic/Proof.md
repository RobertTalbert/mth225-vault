## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **proof** is an explanation for why a [[Propositions|proposition]] is always true under the conditions in which it is stated, that is thorough, free of errors, and clearly expressed. 

The types of proof that you will learn in MTH 225 include: 

- Proof using mathematical induction 
- Combinatorial proof
- As well as simply giving thorough explanations for observed phenomena. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

Here is a very simple proposition: 

> [!NOTE] Proposition
> For all integers $n$, if $n$ is even then $n^2$ is even. 

This proposition appears to be true based on the following examples: 

| $n$   | $0$ | $2$ | $4$  | $6$  | $8$ |
| ----- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| $n^2$ | $0$ | $4$ | $16$ | $36$ | $64$    |

This list of examples provides supporting evidence that the proposition is true, because we have five integers that are all even, and their squares are even. 

**However, this list of examples is not a proof** because the proposition says that if $n$ is even then $n^2$ is even, *for all* integers. This list does not represent all integers, only five of them. 


> [!important] IMPORTANT
> A finite list of examples is not a proof for a global statement about an infinite number of things. 

To prove the proposition, we provide a *proof* that explains why the proposition is true for all integers. **There is typically more than one way to prove a proposition.** The str
