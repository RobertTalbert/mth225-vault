## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **proof** is an explanation for why a [[Propositions|proposition]] is always true under the conditions in which it is stated, that is thorough, free of errors, and clearly expressed. 

The types of proof that you will learn in MTH 225 include: 

- Proof using [[Recursion and Induction/Mathematical induction|mathematical induction]] 
- Combinatorial proof
- As well as simply giving thorough explanations for observed phenomena. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

Here is a very simple proposition: 

> [!NOTE] Proposition
> For all integers $n$, if $n$ is even then $n^2$ is even. 

This proposition appears to be true based on the following examples: 

| $n$   | $0$ | $2$ | $4$  | $6$  | $8$ |
| ----- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | --- |
| $n^2$ | $0$ | $4$ | $16$ | $36$ | $64$    |

This list of examples provides supporting evidence that the proposition is true, because we have five integers that are all even, and their squares are even. 

**However, this list of examples is not a proof** because the proposition says that if $n$ is even then $n^2$ is even, *for all* integers. This list does not represent all integers, only five of them. 


> [!important] IMPORTANT
> A finite list of examples is not a proof for a global statement about an infinite number of things. 

To prove the proposition, we provide a *proof* that explains why the proposition is true for all integers. **There is typically more than one way to prove a proposition.** Often the strategy and outline of the proof is given by the form of the proposition. In this case, the proposition is a [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]]. These are true in all cases except where the [[Conditional statements|hypothesis]] is true and the [[Conditional statements|conclusion]] is false. So an effective argument (known as "direct proof") is to **assume the hypothesis is true, then show that the conclusion must be true**. 

> [!NOTE] Proof
> Assume that $n$ is any even integer. This means that $n$ is two times some other integer, so $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. We want to show that $n^2$ is even, that is, $n^2$ is two times some integer, $n^2 = 2m$. Now square both sides of this equation: $n^2 = (2k)^2$. The right side is equal to $4k^2$ which is equal to $2(2k^2)$. The number in parentheses, $2k^2$, is an integer because squaring one integer gives another integer. If we let $m = 2k^2$ we now have $n^2 = 2m$ and this is what we wanted to show. 

This is a correct proof because it is free of computational and logical errors, and is clearly communicated -- although it may not seem clear at first because it is quite dense, and asks you (the reader) to follow some logical steps. And the language is a little stiff. 

But this need not be *the only* correct proof. There are as many ways to explain a true statement as there are people doing the explanation. As long as we are giving a clear, correct explanation that explains why the proposition is *always* true (not just sometimes, as in a list of examples) then it's a proof.
