## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **connective** refers to a logical operator that joins two [[propositions]] into a new proposition. The four major connectives are: [[Negation]], [[Conjunction]], [[Disjunction]], and [[Conditional statements|Implication]]. 

Notes: 
- Other connectives also exist but are less commonly used, including [[Exclusive OR]], [[Biconditional statement|if and only if]], and  [NAND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate).
