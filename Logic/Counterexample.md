## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **counterexample** is a specific example that shows that a [[Propositions|proposition]] is not always true. 

Notes: 
* Another way to view a counterexample, is that it is an example that proves a global, blanket statement about something is false. 
* A single counterexample is enough to disprove a global statement. 
* However **no finite number of examples will ever prove a global statement**. 

## Examples

- For the proposition "All prime numbers are odd", a counterexample is $p = 2$ because it is a prime number, but it's not odd. This shows that *not all* prime numbers are odd; or in other words the statement "All prime numbers are odd" is false. In this case, $p=2$ is the *only* counterexample. 
- For the proposition "If $x^2 > 0$ then $x > 0$", a counterexample is the number $x = -1$. This shows that the statement is false, because $(-1)^2 > 0$ but $-1 \not > 0$. There are infinitely many other counterexamples -- any negative number will work.
