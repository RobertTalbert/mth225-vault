## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **proposition** is a complete declarative sentence that has a definite, fixed, knowable truth value of either True or False. 

Notes: 
- Propositions are sometimes just called **statements**. 
- Propositions are different from [[Predicate|predicates]] in that a [[predicate]] is a statement whose truth value depends on one or more variables. A proposition has no such dependencies. 


## Examples and Non-Examples

The following are propositions: 
- *Bob ate pizza for lunch.*
- *If $n$ is a positive integer, then $n$ is either a prime number or a product of prime numbers.* 
- $4 = 8/2$
- $4 = 10/2$ (The proposition is false, but it's still a proposition)

The following are *not* propositions: 
- *Grand Rapids is a beautiful city*. (Subjective opinion)
- *Look at that!* (Not a declarative sentence -- does not assert something factual)
- *The number $n$ is an even number.* (Not fixed -- the statement is true for some values of $n$ and false for others. This is instead a [[predicate]].)
