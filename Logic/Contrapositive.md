## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **contrapositive** of the [[Conditional statements|conditional statement]] $P \rightarrow Q$ is the conditional statement $(\neg Q) \rightarrow (\neg P)$. That is, we form the converse by replacing the [[Conditional statements|hypothesis]] of the original statement with the [[Negation|negation]] of the original conclusion, and replacing the [[Conditional statements|conclusion]] of the original statement the negation of the original hypothesis. 

Notes: 

> [!important] **The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always  [[logically equivalent]] to the original statement**.

To see this, here are the [[Truth tables|truth tables]] for $P \rightarrow Q$ and its contrapositive $(\neg Q) \rightarrow (\neg P)$ side by side (with intermediate columns for the negations): 

| $P$   | $Q$   | $\stackrel{\Downarrow}{P \rightarrow Q}$ | $(\neg Q)$ | $(\neg P)$ | $\stackrel{\Downarrow}{(\neg Q) \rightarrow (\neg P)}$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------ | 
| True  | True  | True              | False              | False | True | 
| True  | False | False             | True          | False | False
| False | True  | True              | False         | True | True
| False | False | True              | True                  | True | True 

The original statement is in column 3 and the contrapositive in column 6 (indicated by vertical arrows). Notice the truth values are the same. 

## Examples

Here are some conditional statements and their contrapositives: 

| Statement                        | Converse                         |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| If it's snowing, then it's cold. | If it's not cold, then it's not snowing. |
| If $x > 4$ then $x^2 > 16$.      | If $x^2 \leq  16$ then $x \leq  4$.      |
| My coffee being hot is a consequence of it being freshly brewed. | My coffee not being freshly brewed is a consequence of it not being hot. |                                  |                                  |
