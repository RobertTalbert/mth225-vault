## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **predicate** is a [[Propositions|proposition]] without a definite, fixed truth value but instead its truth value depends on the value of one or more variables. Alternatively, a predicate is a [[function]] that takes in one or more variables as input, and whose outputs are the values `True` or `False`. (That is, its [[codomain]] is the [[set]] `{True, False}`.)
