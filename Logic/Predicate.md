## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **predicate** is a [[Propositions|proposition]] without a definite, fixed truth value but instead its truth value depends on the value of one or more variables. Alternatively, a predicate is a [[function]] that takes in one or more variables as input, and whose outputs are the values `True` or `False`. (That is, its [[codomain]] is the [[set]] `{True, False}`.)

Notes: 
- The truth value of a predicate is undetermined until all variables have been given inputs. By assigning values to the inputs we are [[quantifying]] the predicate. 
- Whereas [[Propositions|propositions]] are notated using single letters (for example, $P$) we typically use [[function notation]] for predicates, indicating the variable or variables in parentheses following a letter; for example $P(n)$ or $Q(x,y)$. 
- The [[domain]] of a predicate refers to the set from which the variables are drawn. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

The statement "The [[natural number]] $n$ is a perfect square" is a predicate because it is neither true nor false -- the truth value depends on the value of $n$.
