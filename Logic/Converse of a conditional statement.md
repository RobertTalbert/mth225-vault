## Examples

Here are some conditional statements and their converses: 

| Statement                        | Converse                         |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| If it's snowing, then it's cold. | If it's cold, then it's snowing. |
| If $x > 4$ then $x^2 > 16$.      | If $x^2 > 16$ then $x > 4$.      |
|                                  |                                  |
