Notes: 
- Other designations for propositions that are similar to theorems include: 
	- *Lemma*. This is a theorem that is not a significant fact on its own, but rather it serves merely to help prove a larger and more significant theorem. 
	- *Corollary*. This is a theorem that follows directly from another, more general theorem, usually as a special case. 
- Another related term is *conjecture*, which is a proposition that we *believe* is true but which does not yet have a proof.
