> [!tldr] Definition
> The **exclusive or**, abbreviated **XOR**, is a logical [[Connectives|connective]] joining two [[Propositions|propositions]], which results in a new proposition that is true only when one of the propositions, *but not both*, is true. The notation for a conjunction is the symbol $\oplus$, and we pronounced $A \oplus B$ as "$A$ XOR $B$". 

Notes: 
- The [[Truth tables|truth table]] for $A \oplus B$ is: 

| $A$   | $B$   | $A \oplus B$ |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| True  | True  | False         |
| True  | False | True        |
| False | True  | True        |
| False | False | False             |

Again, $A \oplus B$ is true only *exactly one* of $A$ or $B$ is true. 

- The [[Disjunction|disjunction]] $A \vee B$ is an "inclusive or" because $A \vee B$ is true if either $A$ or $B$, *or both*, is true.
