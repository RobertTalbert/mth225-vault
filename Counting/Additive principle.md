## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **additive principle** of counting states that if an event $A$ can occur in $m$ ways, and an event $B$ can occur in $n$ ways, and there is no way for $A$ and $B$ to happen at the same time, then the event "$A$ or $B$" can occur in $m+n$ ways. 

Notes: 
* If it *is* possible for $A$ and $B$ to occur at the same time, the number of ways that the event "$A$ or $B$" can happen is given by the [[Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion]]. 
* The Additive Principle is therefore used to count the number of outcomes of
