## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **dots and dividers** method is an approach to counting the number of ways to distribute identical objects to a group of recipients. The basic outline of the method is: 
> 1. Represent each object being distributed as a "dot".
> 2. Represent the *change from one recipient to another* as a "divider". 
> 3. Each distribution is now representable as a sequence of dots and dividers, which can be translated into [[Binary digits and bitstrings|bitstrings]] in which each dot is a `0` and each divider is a `1`. 
> 4. The number of those bitstrings, and hence the number distributions, can then be counted with the [[Binomial coefficient|binomial coefficient]].
