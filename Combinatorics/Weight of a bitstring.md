> [!tldr] Definition
> The **weight** of a [[Binary digits and bitstrings|bitstring]] is the number of $1$ bits it contains. 

Notes
- The number of bitstrings of length $n$ that have weight $k$, is given by the [[binomial coefficient]] $n \choose k$. 

## Examples

| Bitstring | Weight |
| --------- | ------ |
| $101$     | $2$    |
| $111101$  | $5$    |
| $00000$   | $0$    |
