## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Recursion** is the process of computing or constructing an object using simpler versions of itself. A process that exhibits recursion is called *recursive*. 
> 
> A recursive process needs two parts to be fully specified: 
> 1. A *base case* (or base cases) that gives the computation or construction directly without recursion, and 
> 2. A *recursive step* consisting of a set of rules for computing or building all other cases out of simpler cases, eventually terminating in the base case. 

## Examples and Non-Examples
