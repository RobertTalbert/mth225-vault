## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **characteristic root method** is a technique for deriving a [[Solution to a recurrence relation|solution]] to a [[Linear recurrence relation|linear]] [[Homogeneous recurrence relation|homogeneous]] recurrence relation. The general method is as follows: 
> 1. Put the recurrence relation in "standard form" with the new term on the left side of the equals sign and all other objects on the right side. 
> 2. Replace $a_{n}$ with $x^n$, $a_{n-1}$ with $x^{n-1}$, and so on until all sequence terms are replaced with powers of $x$. 
> 3. Divide both sides by the smallest power of $x$ to arrive at a polynomial equation. (This equation is known as the *characteristic equation* for the recurrence relation.) 
> 4. Solve the polynomial equation using basic algebra techniques. The resulting value(s) of $x$ are called the *characteristic roots* of the recurrence relation. 
> 5. If $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k$ are the characteristic roots, the general form of the [[Solution to a recurrence relation|solution]] to the recurrence relation is $a(n) =
