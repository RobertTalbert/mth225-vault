## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A [[sequence]] of numbers is said to be **arithmetic** if each number in the sequence has a common difference with the previous term. Put differently, a sequence is arithmetic if the difference of any two consecutive terms is constant. 

Notes: 
- We say that arithmetics sequences "grow at a constant rate".
- Arithmetic sequences have a [[Recursion|recursive]] definition by letting $a_0$ be the first term of the sequence, then $a_n = b + a_{n-1}$ where $b$ is the common difference 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- The sequence $3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, \dots$ is arithmetic because each term is $2$ plus the previous term. (Or, the difference between any two consecutive terms is $2$.)
- The sequence $10, 5, 0, -5, -10, -15, \dots$ is arithmetic because each item is $-5$ plus the previous term. 
- The sequence $3, 6, 12, 24, 48, \dots$ is *not* arithmetic because there is not a common difference between the terms. For example $6-3 = 3$ but $12 - 6 \neq 3$. (This is a [[Geometric sequence|geometric sequence]] with a common ratio of $2$.)
