## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **recurrence relation** is a formula that defines a sequence using a rule that gives the next term of the sequence terms of previously-computed terms of the sequence. The **order** of the recurrence relation refers to the number of steps backward needed to define the next term. 

Notes: 
- A [[Recursion|recursive]] definition of a sequence consists of two parts: A set of *initial conditions* that explicitly give early terms of the sequence, and a recurrence relation used to build later terms of the sequence from the initial ones.
