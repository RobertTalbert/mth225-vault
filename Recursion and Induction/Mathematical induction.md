## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> **Mathematical induction** is a [[proof]] technique used when proving that a [[Predicate|predicate]] $P(n)$ (whose [[Domain|domain]] is the set of all [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]]) is true for all natural numbers or for some specified [[Subset|subset]]. It is especially applicable if the predicate involves [[Recursion|recursion]]. Induction proofs follow a three-step **framework**: 
> 1. (*Base case*) Establish, by direct computation or demonstration, that $P(n)$ is true for the smallest value of $n$ for which it is claimed to be true. That is, establish that the base case  
> 2. Assume that
