## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A **sequence** is an ordered list of numbers. 

Notes: 
* The main difference between a sequence and a [[Set and set elements|set]] is that sequences are ordered while sets aren't. 
* Sequences can also contain duplicate elements while [[Set and set elements|sets]] cannot. For example $1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, \dots$ is an acceptable sequence. 
* Sequences typically have a *first* element, followed by a second, third, fourth, etc. elements. Typically we [zero-index](https://stringfestanalytics.com/seen-zero-based-indexing/) a sequence, meaning we refer to the first item in the sequence as having "position 0". 
* If we use variables to represent terms in a sequence, we write $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots$ (The letter $a$ can be replaced with other letters; but notice the index of the term appears as a subscript.) 
* Sequences can be expressed as explicit lists, or with
