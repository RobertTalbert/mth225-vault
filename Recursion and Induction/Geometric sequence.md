## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> A [[sequence]] of numbers is said to be **geometric** if each number in the sequence is a fixed multiple of the previous term. Put differently, a sequence is geometric if the ratio of any two consecutive terms is constant. 

Notes: 
- We say that geometric sequences "grow with a constant ratio" or "constant multiple". 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- The sequence $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \dots$ is geometric because each term is $2$ times the previous term. 
- The sequence $3.1, 9.61, 29.791, 92.3521, 286.29151, 887.503681, \dots$ is geometric because each item is $3.1$ times the previous term. It's easier to tell this if you look at the ratios instead. If you take any two consecutive terms and divide them, the result is always $3.1$: $9.61/3.1 = 3.1$, $29.791/9.61 = 3.1$, and so on. 
- The sequence $3.1, 6.2, 9.3, 12.4, 15.5, 18.6, \dots$ is *not* geometric because there is not a common ratio
