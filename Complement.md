## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> If $A$ is a set, the **complement** of $A$ is the set of all points in the [[Universal set|universal set]] that are not in $A$. The notation for the complement of $A$ is $\overline{A}$.
> 
> In [[Set-builder notation|set-builder notation]], $\overline{A} = \{ x \in U \, : \, x \not \in A\}$ (where $U$ is the universal set). 

A visual re
**Notes:**

- The complement of $A$ is also $U \setminus A$, the [[Set difference|set difference]] between the [[Universal set|universal set]] and $A$. 

## Examples 

- If the universal set is $\mathbb{N}$ (the [[Natural numbers|natural numbers]]) and $A = \{}
