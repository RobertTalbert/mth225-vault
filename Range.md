## Definition 

> [!tldr] Definition
> The **range** of a [[Function|function]] is the set consisting of all actual outputs of that function. 

Notes: 
- The range of $f$ is a [[Subset|subset]] of, but is not necessarily equal to, the [[Codomain|codomain]] of $f$. See below for examples where they are different. 
- Whereas the [[Codomain|codomain]] is a general set of "potential" outputs of $f$ (the "data types" of the output), the range is the set of *actual, specific outputs* that are produced by the function. 

## Examples and Non-Examples

- The ceiling function $ceil: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ that takes a real number and rounds it up, has a range of $\mathbb{Z}$ because every integer actually occurs as the output of some input. (For example, $19$ is )
